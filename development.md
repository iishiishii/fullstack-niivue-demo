# Fullstack NiiVue Project - Development

## URLs

The production or staging URLs would use these same paths, but with your own domain.

### Development URLs

Development URLs, for local development.

Frontend: http://localhost:5173

Backend: http://localhost:8000

Automatic Interactive Docs (Swagger UI): http://localhost:8000/docs

Automatic Alternative Docs (ReDoc): http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Local Development

## Local setup using Docker 

Requirements:
- Docker

You need to run the following command that will build the Docker images and will run the app while watching for changes on the codebase for hot reloads. 

```bash
docker compose watch
```

To see the app running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`. 

## Local Setup (Legacy)

Requirements:
- Node.js (for frontend environment)
- npm (for frontend environment)
- pixi (for backend environment)
- git


### frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### backend

```bash
cd backend
pixi install
```

## run the frontend in development mode

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## run the backend in development mode

This hot reloads the backend when changes are made to the code.

> Note: the frontend will be "static" in this mode.

```bash
cd backend
pixi run serve
```

## build the frontend for production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Environment Variables

You can set several variables, like:

* `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of the project, used in the API for the docs and emails.
* `STACK_NAME`: The name of the stack used for Docker Compose labels and project name.
* `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`: A list of allowed CORS origins separated by commas.
* `SECRET_KEY`: The secret key for the FastAPI project, used to sign tokens from WorkOS. This is obtained by encoding automatically generated 32 random bytes.
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER`: The email of the first superuser, this superuser will be the one that can create new users.
* `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`: The password of the first superuser.
* `POSTGRES_SERVER`: The hostname of the PostgreSQL server. You can leave the default of `db`, provided by the same Docker Compose. You normally wouldn't need to change this unless you are using a third-party provider.
* `POSTGRES_PORT`: The port of the PostgreSQL server. You can leave the default. You normally wouldn't need to change this unless you are using a third-party provider.
* `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The Postgres password.
* `POSTGRES_USER`: The Postgres user, you can leave the default.
* `POSTGRES_DB`: The database name to use for this application. You can leave the default of `app`.
* `SENTRY_DSN`: The DSN for Sentry, if you are using it.
